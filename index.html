Keep the HTML code from the previous exercise available for them to see while they work but do not send them the code just yet.
**Instructions:**
* In a new HTML file, create the basic structure of an HTML document and include the following in it:
 * DOCTYPE declaration
 * Head tag with a title tag
 * H1 tag with a title of your choice
 * Embed an image
 * Create the following three links on your page:
   * One link that is `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
   * Make the second link bold.
   * Make the third link a placeholder so it goes nowhere.
**Hint:**
* You should be looking up at the screen pretty often :stuck_out_tongue:
**Bonus:**
* Create an ordered list of steps to make a sandwich.
* Create an unordered list of 5 bands/musicians you like.
* Create a table with 2 columns (animal class and animal name) and 4 rows of animals.
* Use an alternate way of separating links without line breaks.
* Embed a YouTube video of your favorite band/musician.
